## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the selling price of used cars using features such as the car's make, engine size, fuel type, body style, etc. It utilizes machine learning algorithms and optimizers to provide accurate predictions.

The main objectives include:
- Exploring the dataset and extracting meaningful features.
- Training models such as Random Forest and MLP Neural Networks.
- Evaluating the models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R².
- Implementing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

## Features
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Categorical features are encoded using one-hot encoding, and numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler.
- **Feature Engineering**: New features like car age and log transformation of prices are used to improve model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV is used to find the best hyperparameters for the MLP Neural Network.

## Machine Learning Models
This project utilizes the following machine learning models:
- **Random Forest Regressor**: A robust ensemble model that is highly effective for regression tasks.
- **MLP Neural Network**: A multi-layer perceptron trained using optimizers like Adam and SGD.
  
Additional models can be added and evaluated for further performance improvements.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-car-price-prediction.git
   cd used-car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn

## Usage
1. **Run the project**: After installation, run the Python script or Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and make predictions.
   
2. **Prediction Example**: You can use the provided function to predict the price of a car based on user input.
   ```python
   example_price = predict_price(130, 'toyota', 'gas', 'sedan', 100, 30, 5)
   print(f"Predicted price for the input car: {example_price}")
   ```

3. **Model Training**: You can modify the dataset and models to experiment with different feature sets and algorithms.

## Results
- **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on:
  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average error in predicted price.
  - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the spread of the predicted values.
  - **R² Score**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.
  
Best performance and hyperparameters for the models will be displayed at the end of the training.
